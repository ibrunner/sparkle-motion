# Stochastic Detail Illumination: Design Document

## Project Overview

Stochastic Detail Illumination (SDI) is a novel image rendering technique that leverages temporal animation to reveal spatial details from high-resolution images that would otherwise be lost during traditional downsampling. Rather than permanently discarding pixels during downsampling, SDI dynamically cycles through different sampling patterns over time, creating a subtle shimmer effect that reveals additional detail.

## Core Concept

When displaying high-resolution images (e.g., 20MP photos) on smaller screens, traditional resampling methods discard or average pixels, permanently losing information. SDI instead treats these "lost" pixels as a reservoir of detail that can be selectively revealed over time through a probabilistic rendering approach.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Image Analysis Pipeline

- **Edge/Detail Detection**: Analyze the original high-resolution image to identify areas with high contrast and detail.
- **Detail Importance Map**: Generate a weighted map indicating the relative importance of detail in different regions of the image.
- **Performance Adaptation**: Scale analysis complexity based on device capabilities.

### 2. Temporal Rendering Core

- **Stochastic Update System**: Rather than updating every pixel every frame, pixels are treated as "particles" that update at a controlled rate (e.g., 500 updates per second).
- **Weighted Probability Distribution**: Areas with higher detail in the importance map receive more frequent updates.
- **Temporal Decay**: After a pixel is updated with detail information, it gradually fades back to the baseline resampled value.
- **Frame Rate Independence**: System adapts the number of updates based on available performance and display capabilities.

### 3. Interaction Layer

- **Cursor/Touch Interaction**: Areas near the cursor or touch point receive additional detail updates.
- **Device Motion Sensing**: On mobile devices, accelerometer data influences the distribution of detail updates.
- **Detail "Flow"**: Create a natural feeling that detail "pours" toward areas of interest or interaction.

## Implementation Technologies

### Primary Approach: WebGL

- **GLSL Shaders**: Implement core rendering algorithms as fragment shaders.
- **Multi-pass Rendering**:
  - First pass: Edge detection and detail analysis
  - Second pass: Update selection and temporal rendering
- **TypeScript Application Layer**: Handle setup, WebGL context management, and interaction events.

### Fallback Approach: Canvas + TypeScript

- **CPU-Based Processing**: Implement core algorithms in TypeScript if shader programming becomes challenging.
- **Canvas Rendering**: Use standard canvas for displaying processed images.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Potentially use WebGL for rendering while performing key calculations in TypeScript.

## Visual Effect Parameters

- **Update Rate**: Control how many pixels receive "illumination" updates per second.
- **Decay Rate**: How quickly updated pixels fade back to the baseline.
- **Detail Threshold**: Minimum level of detail required for a region to receive updates.
- **Interaction Influence**: Strength of interaction effects on update distribution.
- **Animation Subtlety**: Overall intensity of the effect, adjustable for different contexts.

## Performance Considerations

- **Adaptive Quality**: Scale the number of updates based on device capabilities.
- **Pre-processing**: Perform heavy analysis during image load rather than at runtime.
- **Batched Updates**: Group pixel updates to minimize draw calls.
- **Detail Culling**: Skip updates for off-screen or obscured areas.

## User Experience Goals

- **Subtle Enhancement**: The effect should not be distracting but should noticeably improve detail perception.
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Users should naturally discover that interaction reveals more detail.
- **Accessibility**: Provide static high-quality fallback for users who may be sensitive to subtle animation.
- **Performance First**: Maintain smooth frame rates across devices, scaling quality rather than sacrificing performance.

## Potential Applications

- **Photography Viewing**: Enhance detail when viewing high-resolution photographs.
- **Digital Art**: Allow artists to preserve fine details even on lower-resolution displays.
- **Medical Imaging**: Potentially enhance the visibility of subtle details in medical scans.
- **Satellite/Aerial Imagery**: Reveal fine details in large-scale aerial or satellite imagery.
- **E-commerce**: Show product details more clearly, particularly for textures and materials.
